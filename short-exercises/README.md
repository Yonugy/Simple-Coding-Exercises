## Question 1
Write a program that accepts the user's first and last name and prints them in reverse order with a space between them.
<br>Sample:
<br>Input your First Name: Dany                                       
Input your Last Name: Boon                                        
Hello Boon Dany

## Question 2
Write a program that accepts the user's first and last name in a single line and prints them in reverse order with a space between them.
<br>Tips: use split() function to separate the string into 2.
<br>Sample:
<br>Input your Name: Dany Boon                                       
Hello Boon Dany

## Question 3
Write a program to test whether a passed letter is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u).
<br>Sample:
<br>input: v  ;output: false
<br>input: e  ;output: true

## Question 4
Write a program to check whether a person is overweight or not by calculating their BMI value.
<br>Formula for BMI: weight (in kg) / height (in m)**2, use weight divided by height (in m) square
<br>Less than 18.4 - underweight
<br>18.5 to 24.9 - normal weight
<br>25 to 29.9 - overweight
<br>30 to 34.9 - obesity

## Question 5
Write a program to calculate the largest number among 3 numbers.

## Question 6
Write a program to calculate the student getting the highest marks among 3 students.
<br>Sample:
<br>Input first student: Amy 85
<br>Input second student: Dan 76
<br>Input third student: Ben 97
<br>Highest mark: Ben

## Question 7
Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

## Question 8
Write a program to round a floating-point number to specified number decimal places. Tips: Use round() function
<br>Sample:
<br>Input number to round: 212.374
<br>Input number of decimal places to round: 2
<br>Output: 212.37

## Question 9
Write a program to check whether a number is divisible by another number.
<br>Sample:
<br>input: 20 5  ;output: True
<br>input: 20 3  ;output: False

## Question 10
Write a program that accepts six numbers as input and sorts them in descending order. Tips: Use sort() function
<br>Sample:
<br>Input six integers: 15 30 25 14 35 40
<br>After sorting the said integers: 40 35 30 25 15 14

## Question 11
Write a program that take 2 inputs from user and return result whether:
<br>a. two numbers are equal
<br>b. number 1 is greater than number 2
<br>c. number 1 is smaller than number 2

## Question 12
Accept three numbers from the user and display the second largest number.

## Question 13
Write a Python function to sum all the score in the given list as below.
<br>student_marks = [58, 65, 89, 73, 72, 80, 76]

## Question 14
Write a Python function that takes the list below and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list
<br>Hint: the new list cannot contain duplicate value, you can use list.append() to add item to the end of the list
<br>average_height = [53.2, 54.5, 76.8, 75.8, 53.2, 53.2, 76.8, 78.1, 78.1, 54.5, 75.5, 53.2, 53.2, 76.8, 75.8]

## Question 15
Write a Python function that takes a number as a parameter and check the number is prime or not, print out True or False.
<br>Prime number is a natural number greater than 1 and no divisors other than 1 and itself.
<br>E.g 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13
<br>All even number is not a prime number as it can be divided by 2.
<br>9 is not the prime number as it can be divided by 3.

## Question 16
Write a Python function to checks whether a string is a palindrome or not
<br>Palindrome is refers to the word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.
<br>E.g. madam, kakak, level, kayak, refer

## Question 17
Write a program to display "Hello" if a number entered by user is a multiple of five.
<br>If number entered is a multiple of five:
<br>If number entered is an even number, print "Nice to meet you".
<br>If number entered is a odd number, print "See you later".

## Question 18
Write a program to calculate the electricity bill (take input of unit from user) according to the following criteria:
<br>First 100 units, price per unit: no charge
<br>Next 100 units, price per unit: RM2.10 per unit
<br>More than 200 units, price per unit: RM2.80 per unit

## Question 19
Write a program to check whether the last digit of a number (entered by user) is divisible by 5 or not.

## Question 20
Write a program that takes an integer input score (ranging from 0 to 100) and returns the corresponding letter grade based on the following grading scheme:
<br>80-100: Grade A
<br>70-79: Grade B
<br>60-69: Grade C
<br>50-59: Grade D
<br>40-49: Grade E
<br>0-39: Grade F
