1) Write a program which accepts the user's first and last name and print them in reverse order with 
a space between them
Sample:
Input your First Name : Dany                                       
Input your Last Name : Boon                                        
Hello Boon Dany

2) Write a program which accepts the user's first and last name in a single line and print them in
reverse order with a space between them. Tips: use split() function to separate the string into 2
Sample:
Input your Name : Dany Boon                                       
Hello Boon Dany

3) Write a program to test whether a passed letter is a vowel(a, e, i, o, u) or not.
Sample:
input: v  output: false
input: e  output: true

4) Write a program to check whether a person is overweight or not by calculating their BMI value.
#Formula for BMI: weight (in kg) / height (in m)**2, use weight divide height (in m) square
#Less than 18.4 - underweight
#18.5 to 24.9 - normal weight
#25 to 29.9 - overweight
#30 to 34.9 - obesity

5) Write a program to calculate the largest number among 3 numbers.

6) Write a program to calculate the student getting the highest marks among 3 students.
Sample:
Input first student: Amy 85
Input second student: Dan 76
Input third student: Ben 97
Highest mark: Ben

7) Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative or zero.

8) Write a program to round a floating-point number to specified number decimal places. Tips: Use round() function
Sample:
Input number to round: 212.374
Input number of decimal places to round: 2
Output: 212.37

9) Write a program to check whether a number is divisible by another number.
Sample:
input: 20 5  output: True
input: 20 3  output: False

10) Write a program that accepts six numbers as input and sorts them in descending order. Tips: Use sort() function
Sample:
Input six integers: 15 30 25 14 35 40
After sorting the said integers: 40 35 30 25 15 14

11) Write a program that take 2 inputs from user and return result whether:
a. two numbers are equal
b. number 1 is greater than number 2
c. number 1 is smaller than number 2

12) Accept three numbers from the user and display the second largest number.

13) 2. Write a Python function to sum all the score in the given list as below
student_marks = [58, 65, 89, 73, 72, 80, 76]

14) Write a Python function that takes the list below and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list
Hint: the new list cannot contain duplicate value, you can use list.append() - add item to the end of the list
average_height = [53.2, 54.5, 76.8, 75.8, 53.2, 53.2, 76.8, 78.1, 78.1, 54.5, 75.5, 53.2, 53.2, 76.8, 75.8]

15) Write a Python function that takes a number as a parameter and check the number is prime or not, print out True or False
#Prime number is a natural number greater than 1 and no divisors other than 1 and itself
#E.g 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13
#All even number is not a prime number as it can be divided by 2
#9 is not the prime number as it can be divided by 3

16) Write a Python function to checks whether a string is a palindrome or not
#Palindrome is refers to the word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.
#E.g. madam, kakak, level, kayak, refer

17) Write a program to display "Hello" if a number entered by user is a multiple of five.
#if number entered is an even number, print "Nice to meet you"
#if number entered is a odd number, print "See you later"

18) Write a program to calculate the electricity bill (take input of unit from user) according to the following criteria:
#First 100 units, price per unit: no charge
#Next 100 units, price per unit: Rm 2.10 per unit
#More than 200 units, price per unit: Rm 2.80 per unit

19) Write a program to check whether the last digit of a number (entered by user) is divisible by 5 or not.

20) Write a program that takes an integer input score (ranging from 0 to 100) and returns the corresponding letter grade based on the following grading scheme:
80-100: Grade A
70-79: Grade B
60-69: Grade C
50-59: Grade D
40-49: Grade E
0-39: Grade F

21) Write a program that determines the cardinal direction based on the given angle. The angle represents the degrees on a compass, where:
0 to 45 degrees: North
46 to 135 degrees: East
136 to 225 degrees: South
226 to 315 degrees: West
316 to 360 degrees: North
If the input angle is outside the range of 0 to 360 degrees, print "Invalid".
